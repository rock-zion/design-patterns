# design-patterns
For a while now I have felt like there's something missing in my work and I think it is Design Patterns.

This repository details my deep dive into the world of design patterns and the exploration of code organisation and its implementation with either vanilla javascript or an organizational library or framework.

To demonstrate my use of Design Patterns, I'll be implimenting a simple webapp called cat clicker, check it out [here](https://zion-cat-clicker.netlify.app), based off of the 2010 Cow Clicker game by Ian Bogost.

By just being more intentional about my code I can already see the pitfalls of üçùüçù spaghetti code, from hard to follow logic to excessive repetitions, a general lack of structure and impending scalability issues and this is where Design Patterns come into play.

MVC: Model-View-Controller is a design patter that breaks up an application into three parts: the data(Model), the presentation of the data to the user(View) and the actions taken to manipulate data(Controller).
